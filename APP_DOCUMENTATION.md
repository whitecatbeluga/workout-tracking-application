##### 2. User login

Registered users can log in to access their personalized workout data and settings.

##### 3. Create routine

Users can create custom routines, which are structured plans consisting of specific workouts designed to meet fitness goals..

##### 4. Create program / folder

Users can create programs (or folders) to organize workouts based on type or training objectives (e.g., strength, cardio, HIIT). These act as collections of exercises grouped under a theme.
